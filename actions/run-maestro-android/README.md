# run-maestro-android

Boots a **headless** Android emulator (`-no-window -no-audio -gpu
swiftshader_indirect`, no boot animation, no snapshot save), waits for
`sys.boot_completed` before installing, installs the packaged `.apk`, runs a
Maestro flow shard, and — regardless of pass/fail — captures a final
screenshot plus full and crash logcat, uploaded as an artifact. The emulator
is always killed at the end (`if: always()`).

Uses `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner`, which owns the emulator
boot/kill lifecycle; this action supplies the headless flags and the
install+Maestro script that runs inside it.
